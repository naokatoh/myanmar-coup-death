# myanmar-coup-death

- After the 2021's coup in Myanmar, more than a year has passed.

- Many countries, including the United States, condemned Myanmar's military regime and countered it with economic sanctions and other measures. However, the democratization process that has been underway since the 2010s has not been restored. Meanwhile, the military junta continues to repress its citizens. Death tolls continue to rise almost every day.

- The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (the AAPP Burma), an activist group, has been recording every death and the arrested and publishing it on the daily basis. By April 30, more than 1800 people had reportedly been killed in the post-coup military crackdown.

- This project aims to visualize [the AAPP's list as of April 15](https://aappb.org/?p=21071) and to tell the stories of those who fell. Chronological analysis of the list indicates that the military regime has increased repression, not lessened, over the past year.
